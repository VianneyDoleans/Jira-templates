# Jira-templates

In this repository, you will find some templates for Jira. The templates have to be used in description field of your ticket (copy-paste the template text in your ticket description, then complete it).   

To have explanation about these templates, you can read the [online documentation](https://github.com/VianneyDoleans/Jira-templates/wiki).

If this is the first time you're using these templates, I recommend you to read the online documentation before publishing your ticket.
